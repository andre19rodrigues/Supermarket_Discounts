# Supermarket_Discounts
**Automatically checks if your favorite products have discounts at Continente supermarket**

This script is particularly useful for finding discounts on products with long or none shelf life, such as beer, shampoo, toothpaste, water, juice, whatever. When there are discounts you can buy several products at one time.

To improve the usage of this script add it to crontab and set it to send you an email whenever there are discounts, for example.

**It only works with Continente supermarket**, which is where I shop, but you can easily adapt to any other.

Just add your products in the file 'products.csv' and enjoy!
